Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of February 5th 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Degoogle-your-life/issues/) make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/seanpm2001 repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate (pretty ironic for an anti-Google campaign) I am working on finding an alternative. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

Due to maintenance issues, many translations are out of date and are using an outdated version of this `README` article file. A translator is needed. Also, as of April 9th 2021, it is going to take me a while to get all the new links working.

# What the FLoC

## Problems with Googles big FLoCing ad problem and another major reason why you should stop using Google Chrome

![Google_Chrome_icon_(September_2014).svg](/Graphics/Google/Chrome/2014/Google_Chrome_icon_(September_2014).svg)

This is an article on the problems with Googles FLoC spyware system, which is included into Google Chrome, and also why you should stop using Google Chrome due to other big privacy problems. I don't feel like anyone should be using Chrome in 2021, or want to use it, as every other modern web browser has succeeded Chrome on its many issues. [Chrome has become the new Internet Explorer 6](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16805216/google-chrome-only-sites-internet-explorer-6-web-standards). It is time for the next browser to take over. This article will help you make your choice (if you haven't already)

## Overview

Google FLoC (Federated Learning of Cohorts) is Googles new spyware system to replace HTTP/browser cookies, which are going obsolete. This solution is ineffective, and highly dangerous, due to how much data it collects and who it shares it with (all your personal info will be shared with any Google site you visit)

General description from the [English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_Learning_of_Cohorts)

```
Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) is a type of web tracking through federated learning.
It groups people based on their browsing history for the purpose of interest-based advertising.
Google began testing the technology in the Chrome browser in the second quarter of 2021 as a replacement for third-party cookies, which it plans to stop supporting in Chrome by late 2021 or early 2022.
FLoC is being developed as a part of Google's Privacy Sandbox Initiative, which includes several other advertising-related technologies with bird-themed names.
As of April 2021, every browser based on Google's open-source Chromium platform (other than Google Chrome) had declined to implement FLoC, including Microsoft Edge and Opera.
```

***

## FLoCking to FLoC

### What browsers support FLoC

1. Google/Google Chrome

2. Google/Google Chromium

Total: 2 web browsers

### What browsers decline suppport for FLoC

The following browser developers have done the right thing and refused to implement FLoC in their browsers:

1. Mozilla/Firefox

2. Microsoft/Edge

3. Microsoft/Internet Explorer 11

4. Vivaldi/Vivaldi

5. DuckDuckGo/DuckDuckGo browser

6. Apple/Safari

7. Tor/Tor browser

8. Ecosia/Ecosia browser

9. Brave/Brave browser

10. Opera software/Opera

11. Seamonkey Council/Seamonkey

12. Cake technologies/Cake browser

13. And pretty much every browser develop (excluding Google)

***

## FLoC workarounds

By default, Google FLoC cannot be turned off, no matter what you do. It doesn't matter if you opt out, it doesn't matter if you live in Switzerland or the middle of the Atlantic Ocean on a boat, FLoC is always on if you have Chrome installed.

FLoC has already been exploited before its full release. DuckDuckGo has a working system that blocks FLoC within Google Chrome, which is no easy feat for anything privacy related.

### The real solution

The real solution to FLoC is to tell Google no, and delete Google Chrome (extremely difficult to do on Android) and switch to a browser that cares about its users freedoms and privacy. [Read more on why you should stop using Google Chrome](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Why-you-should-stop-using-Chrome)

## How FLoC works

Excerpt from the [English Wikipedia] on April 19th 2021:

The Federated Learning of Cohorts analyzes users' online activity within the browser, and generates a "cohort ID" using the SimHash algorithm to group a given user with other users who access similar content. Websites are then able to access the cohort ID using an API and determine what advertisements to serve. Google does not label cohorts based on interest beyond grouping them and assigning an ID, so advertisers need to determine the user types of each cohort on their own.

The process used to generate cohorts without sending user browsing data outside the device is similar to the method behind Google's predictive keyboard.

No matter what you do, when you are using Chrome, all of your sensitive personal data is being sent to Google and others. Google has also been spotted going through open programs. For example, from personal experience (on Firefox) with a YouTube tab open that I didn't visit, I watched several videos offline (VLC Media Player) Later when I went to check the recommendations, it was nearly everything that I had watched. There is no doubt they are spying on other programs too.

In Chrome (and many other browsers) an incognito mode is present. In Chrome, this mode is pointless, as Google will still mine your data. Even if you turn data mining/tracking off, and enable the "do not track" signal, surprise suprise, Google is still mining your data.

Using DuckDuckGo to protect your privacy on Chrome only helps for what you search, but Google will still mine your data, so it isn't as effective.

If you think you have nothing to hide, **you are absolutely wrong**. This argument has been debunked many times over:

[Via Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide_argument#Criticism)

1. Edward Snowden remarked "Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say. "When you say, ‘I have nothing to hide,’ you’re saying, ‘I don’t care about this right.’ You’re saying, ‘I don’t have this right, because I’ve got to the point where I have to justify it.’ The way rights work is, the government has to justify its intrusion into your rights."

2. Daniel J. Solove stated in an article for The Chronicle of Higher Education that he opposes the argument; he stated that a government can leak information about a person and cause damage to that person, or use information about a person to deny access to services even if a person did not actually engage in wrongdoing, and that a government can cause damage to one's personal life through making errors. Solove wrote "When engaged directly, the nothing-to-hide argument can ensnare, for it forces the debate to focus on its narrow understanding of privacy. But when confronted with the plurality of privacy problems implicated by government data collection and use beyond surveillance and disclosure, the nothing-to-hide argument, in the end, has nothing to say."

3. Adam D. Moore, author of Privacy Rights: Moral and Legal Foundations, argued, "it is the view that rights are resistant to cost/benefit or consequentialist sort of arguments. Here we are rejecting the view that privacy interests are the sorts of things that can be traded for security." He also stated that surveillance can disproportionately affect certain groups in society based on appearance, ethnicity, sexuality, and religion.

4. Bruce Schneier, a computer security expert and cryptographer, expressed opposition, citing Cardinal Richelieu's statement "If one would give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest man, I would find something in them to have him hanged", referring to how a state government can find aspects in a person's life in order to prosecute or blackmail that individual. Schneier also argued "Too many wrongly characterize the debate as 'security versus privacy.' The real choice is liberty versus control."

5. Harvey A. Silverglate estimated that the common person, on average, unknowingly commits three felonies a day in the US.

6. Emilio Mordini, philosopher and psychoanalyst, argued that the "nothing to hide" argument is inherently paradoxical. People do not need to have "something to hide" in order to hide "something". What is hidden is not necessarily relevant, claims Mordini. Instead, he argues an intimate area which can be both hidden and access-restricted is necessary since, psychologically speaking, we become individuals through the discovery that we could hide something to others.

7. Julian Assange stated "There is no killer answer yet. Jacob Appelbaum (@ioerror) has a clever response, asking people who say this to then hand him their phone unlocked and pull down their pants. My version of that is to say, 'well, if you're so boring then we shouldn't be talking to you, and neither should anyone else', but philosophically, the real answer is this: Mass surveillance is a mass structural change. When society goes bad, it's going to take you with it, even if you are the blandest person on earth."

8. Ignacio Cofone, law professor, argues that the argument is mistaken in its own terms because, whenever people disclose relevant information to others, they also disclose irrelevant information. This irrelevant information has privacy costs and can lead to other harms, such as discrimination.

I am using the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
